# DE-LIMP: Differential Expression & Limpa Proteomics

Find which proteins are significantly different between your experimental conditions -- upload a DIA-NN output file and get interactive volcano plots, heatmaps, pathway enrichment, and AI-powered interpretation, all without writing code.

Built on R Shiny with the [limpa](https://bioconductor.org/packages/limpa/) pipeline for normalization and protein quantification, and [limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/limma/) for statistical testing with FDR correction. See [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md#glossary) for methodology details.

**Web app input:** DIA-NN `report.parquet` | **Also supported (local/HPC install):** DDA search via Sage + de novo sequencing (Cascadia/Casanovo) | **Not for:** TMT/iTRAQ, Spectronaut/MaxQuant output

> **Not sure if your data is DIA?** If your core facility used DIA-NN to process your samples, you have DIA data. Look for a `report.parquet` file in your results folder. If your data was processed with MaxQuant, Spectronaut, or Proteome Discoverer, or if you used isobaric labels (TMT, iTRAQ), DE-LIMP is not the right tool.

## What's New in v4.0.0

**De novo sequencing + DDA database search** -- DE-LIMP now goes beyond DIA differential expression. New de novo (Cascadia / Casanovo) and DDA (Sage) workflows add per-spectrum sequencing, Sage-vs-de-novo agreement views, and **homology-based species identification** (DIAMOND against nr with LCA assignment) — with a decoy-spectra-calibrated FDR so you can report confirmed peptides at a controlled error rate. Alignment views render only real BLAST alignments, never fabricated positions.

**Proteogenomics — Build sample-specific FASTA databases from your matched RNA-seq** -- Upload RNA-seq fastq files or provide SRA/SLIMS accessions, and DE-LIMP runs an HPC pipeline chain (fastp → bowtie2 rRNA filter → STAR → stringtie → merge → gffcompare → gffread → TransDecoder) to predict novel ORFs and alternative splice variants. The final FASTA auto-assembles with your canonical proteome (UniProt or NCBI RefSeq), registers in the FASTA library catalog, and shows up as a "Proteogenomics DBs" option in the main search page's FASTA Database dropdown. Reference genomes: Human, Mouse, Pig, Rat, Arabidopsis (Bovine and Maize building). Multi-user catalog discovery via "Restore from Hive" and "Discover from Hive" buttons. Includes an "Explain this workflow" modal for proteomics users new to RNA-seq.

**Two analysis pipelines, one app** -- Choose between **DPC-Quant + limma** (limpa's detection-probability model, default) and **MaxLFQ + limma** (paper-faithful Moschem et al. 2025 implementation). The pipeline you pick is recorded in the dataset itself; methods text, AI prompts, exports, and the Reproducibility log all describe whichever pipeline actually ran -- no hardcoded "DPC-Quant" strings anywhere.

**QuantUMS quality filters** -- Optional pre-filtering of DIA-NN precursors by `eQ`, `qQ`, and `pgQ` quality scores (Moschem 2025). Applied at pipeline run-time on the parquet, with a waterfall showing how many precursors and proteins survived each filter. Defaults to off; opt-in checkbox lets you feed filtered data through limpa's DPC-Quant if you want to test the combination.

**On/Off Proteins panel** -- New sub-tab in DE Dashboard surfaces proteins detected in ≥N samples of one condition AND zero samples of the other. limma assigns these `NA` logFC, so they're invisible in the volcano -- the new panel makes them findable.

**Coverage filter** -- Drop proteins with fewer than X non-NA samples before limma fits the model (UC Davis Bioinformatics Core convention). Live waterfall shows protein retention. Available in MaxLFQ + limma mode.

**Run Comparator pipeline-aware** -- Cross-tool DE comparison (DE-LIMP vs DE-LIMP / Spectronaut / FragPipe) now reads the pipeline descriptor on both sides. Hypothesis-engine rules (rollup, normalization, peptide rules) emit the correct contrast based on whether each side used MaxLFQ or DPC-Quant.

**Export Complete Analysis is now a true superset** -- Single ZIP at Output > Export Complete Analysis includes DE results, QC metrics, phospho results (when present), expression matrix, detection matrix, quartile profiles, variable proteins, contaminant summary, search_info.md, methods.txt, parameters.txt, reproducibility_log.R + sessionInfo, session.rds, and a DE-aware **PROMPT.md** for LLM analysis. Every section is wrapped in `safe_section()` and a **MANIFEST.txt** records what was included vs skipped and why. The three redundant "Export for Claude" buttons (Data Explorer, AI Summary, AI Chat) are now consolidated into this single download.

**FASTA picker** -- Scanning a shared FASTA directory (e.g. `/quobyte/proteomics-grp/de-limp/fasta`) used to silently combine every `.fasta` it found. Now: 1 file → use directly; ≥2 files → checkbox modal so you pick exactly which one(s) to use. Local browse and SSH scan both fixed.

**Provenance block** -- Exports include parquet MD5, full sessionInfo, app version, and pipeline label so reanalysis is bit-reproducible.

**Previous highlights** (v3.10): Two analysis pipelines, QuantUMS quality filters, On/Off proteins, Coverage filter, FASTA picker, provenance block. (v3.7): NCBI Proteome Download with gene mapping, Contaminant Analysis with keratin flagging, Data Explorer (quartile + scatter), SSH File Browser, Load from HPC, WSL2 Launcher for Windows, No-Replicates Mode, SSH Auto-Connect, Environment Badge.

**Earlier highlights** (v3.5): Run Comparator, Search & Analysis History, Chromatography QC, smart HPC partitions. (v3.1): UI overhaul, Core Facility Mode. (v3.0): MOFA2, Docker search, phosphoproteomics, GSEA.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for full release history.

## Which Installation Should I Use?

| Platform | Method | DIA-NN Search? | Guide |
|----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| **Any (just exploring)** | Web browser | No | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/brettsp/de-limp-proteomics) |
| **Windows (recommended)** | **WSL2 + native Linux R** | Yes (local + HPC) | **[WINDOWS_WSL_INSTALL.md](WINDOWS_WSL_INSTALL.md)** |
| **Windows (alternative)** | Docker + SSH to HPC | Yes (local + HPC) | [WINDOWS_DOCKER_INSTALL.md](WINDOWS_DOCKER_INSTALL.md) |
| **Mac / Linux** | R/RStudio (native) | Via HPC | See [Installation](#installation) below |
| **HPC cluster** | Apptainer/Singularity | Via SLURM | [HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md](HPC_DEPLOYMENT.md) |

> **Why WSL over Docker on Windows?** WSL2 runs a real Ubuntu environment natively in Windows 10/11. R and Bioconductor packages compile cleanly, SSH keys use normal Unix permissions (no CRLF / 0600 / missing-newline gymnastics), no 9p filesystem perf tax, and no .NET download blocked by corporate firewalls. The Docker path still works and is kept for users who already depend on it, but new installs should start with WSL.

## Installation

**Requirements:** R 4.5 or newer (for limpa). Everything else is installed automatically the first time you launch the app.

### Mac -- step-by-step (first-time users)

If this is your first time running an R/Shiny app, do these four steps in order. Skip ahead to **Already have R, RStudio, and Git?** below if you don't need the walkthrough.

**1. Install R**

Download the right installer for your Mac from CRAN: <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/>

- Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4): pick the **`-arm64.pkg`** file.
- Intel Mac: pick the **`-x86_64.pkg`** file (also labelled "older Macs").

Open the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts. Not sure which chip you have? Click the Apple menu → "About This Mac". "Apple M*x*" = arm64; anything starting with "Intel" = x86_64.

**2. Install RStudio (recommended)**

Download from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and drag RStudio to `/Applications`. RStudio is the friendliest way to run R on a Mac. (VS Code with the R extension also works if you prefer it.)

**3. Install Git**

The simplest way: open the **Terminal** app (Cmd-Space, type "Terminal", Enter) and run:

```bash
git --version
```

If Git is missing, macOS will pop up a dialog asking to install the Xcode Command Line Tools -- click "Install" and wait. That installs Git, no Apple Developer account needed.

**4. Download DE-LIMP and launch it**

Still in Terminal:

```bash
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP.git
```

This creates `~/Documents/DE-LIMP/`. Now open RStudio. In the R console (the bottom-left pane), paste:

```r
shiny::runApp('~/Documents/DE-LIMP', port = 3838, launch.browser = TRUE)
```

The first launch takes 5--15 minutes -- DE-LIMP installs ~30 R packages from CRAN and Bioconductor automatically. Subsequent launches start in seconds. When it's done, your browser opens to the DE-LIMP app.

**Updating later:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/DE-LIMP
git pull
```

Then re-launch from RStudio. Updating the app code never needs you to reinstall R or RStudio.

### Already have R, RStudio, and Git?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bsphinney/DE-LIMP.git
cd DE-LIMP
```

```r
shiny::runApp('.', port = 3838, launch.browser = TRUE)
```

All dependencies install automatically on first run:

- **Core:** shiny, bslib, plotly, DT, rhandsontable, shinyjs, dplyr, tidyr, stringr, readr, arrow, ggplot2, ggrepel, ggridges
- **Stats:** limpa, limma, ComplexHeatmap, clusterProfiler, org.Hs.eg.db, org.Mm.eg.db, AnnotationDbi, enrichplot, KSEAapp, ggseqlogo, MOFA2, basilisk, callr
- **AI / network:** httr2, curl

### Troubleshooting first launch

- **"Package 'limpa' is missing" or "Missing required packages"** -- DE-LIMP installs missing packages automatically, but right after a brand-new R release (e.g. you just installed R 4.6) the BiocManager helper can lag a few weeks behind in knowing which Bioconductor branch pairs with the new R. DE-LIMP v3.7.3+ falls back to a direct Bioconductor download in that case, so just rerun the launch command once and the install finishes. Make sure Wi-Fi is on; the first run needs internet.
- **"R version: 4.x.y (NEED: 4.5+)"** -- you have an older R. Upgrade from <https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/macosx/> and rerun.
- **Permission denied when installing packages** -- you're trying to install into the system library. Either run RStudio normally (it sets up a personal library automatically) or, in a Terminal R session, type `dir.create(Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER"), recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)` once.
- **Port 3838 already in use** -- another R session is already serving the app. In RStudio, click "Session → Restart R", then relaunch. Or change the port: `shiny::runApp(..., port = 3839)`.

## Claude Skill: agentic proteomics pipeline

Prefer to just *describe* your experiment and let an AI run the whole thing? DE-LIMP
ships a **Claude skill** (`proteomics-pipeline`) that goes from raw mass-spec files to
differentially expressed proteins end-to-end — it detects DIA/DDA + instrument,
auto-installs the toolchain (no admin needed), runs DIA-NN or Sage with parameters
derived from your data type, then limpa/limma DE, and writes a biological analysis
report plus a full reproducibility bundle, all packaged into tidy session folders.
It runs in **Claude Code** and **Claude Desktop**.

**Install (one time):**
```
/plugin marketplace add bsphinney/DE-LIMP
/plugin install proteomics-pipeline
```
On **Claude Desktop**: *Customize → Plugins → Browse plugins*, add the marketplace
`bsphinney/DE-LIMP`, then install **proteomics-pipeline**.

**Use it:** just say *"analyze my proteomics data in `~/data/HeLaQC` — it's human,
first 3 are control, last 3 treated."* It asks only for what it can't detect
(organism, conditions) and does the rest. First run installs its toolchain (a few
minutes, one time).

Source and docs: [`skill/proteomics-pipeline/`](skill/proteomics-pipeline). Validated
search workflows live in [`workflows/`](workflows).

## Usage

1. **Load Data** -- Upload a DIA-NN `report.parquet` output file, or click "Load Example Data" for a demo HeLa dataset
2. **Assign Groups & Run** -- Auto-guess groups from filenames or manually assign; optionally add covariates (batch, etc.); click "Run Pipeline" to execute DPC-CN normalization, DPC-Quant protein quantification, and limma DE
3. **Explore Results** -- Data Overview, QC, DE Dashboard (Volcano/Table/PCA/CV Analysis), Phospho, GSEA, MOFA2, AI Analysis, XIC Viewer (local/HPC)
4. **Export** -- Download reproducibility log (.R), save session (.rds), export tables and plots

## Methodology

| Step | Method |
|------|--------|
| **Normalization** | Data Point Correspondence - Cyclic Normalization (DPC-CN) via `limpa::dpcCN()` |
| **Quantification** | DPC-Quant (Detection Probability Curve Quantification): precursor-to-protein rollup via probabilistic missing-value modelling, via `limpa::dpcQuant()` |
| **DE model** | Linear model fit via `limpa::dpcDE()` + `limma::contrasts.fit()` |
| **Moderation** | Empirical Bayes moderated *t*-statistics via `limma::eBayes()` |
| **FDR** | Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted *p*-values |
| **Phospho DE** | Same limma pipeline at the phosphosite level (independent from protein-level) |
